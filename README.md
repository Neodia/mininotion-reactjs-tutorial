# Mini-Notion

This repo serves as my work journal where I'll write everything about my learning process of ReactJS.

I'm trying to learn more about this Framework because it seems to be in high demand in the industry, and I want to
maximise my chances of finding a job.

The goal is to follow the ReactJS tutorial, and then change the code to implement a mini version of my favourite note
taking system, Notion. This mini version will only allow us to create new note using markdown. The notes won't be stored
as it will only be a Frontend system.

The following text is my learning journal from newest to older updates.
